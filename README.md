# Wigle Extract

(Working on a big update.  Give me some time please.

To do's

1) Make application resizeable
2) Convert development to Qt Creator
3) Create Settings Tab
4) Create Info Tab
5) Make an output function
6) Make a search function for specific network names


If you have any ideas, just makee an Issue tab and write whatever you want ;)

Wigle-Extract is a program that can interact with
the CSV files from wigle. It scans for weak secured 
WiFi networks based on my personal experiences. 

It has a nice looking CLI and I will release weekly
updates.  A GUI is also in plan.
